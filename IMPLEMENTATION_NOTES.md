# Implementation Notes

## Status
✅ **Core implementation complete!** All major components have been created and integrated.
✅ **Advanced features implemented**: Jump evasion, Backoff, Advancing, Tie-breaking system, Per-actor throttling

## Architecture Overview

The plugin follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Hooks** - Intercepts `RE::Character::Update` at vtable index 0xAD (post-hook pattern)
2. **CombatDirector** - Singleton manager that processes actors and coordinates components (with per-actor throttling)
3. **ActorStateObserver** - Gathers comprehensive combat state data (self + target, including casting/bow drawing detection)
4. **DecisionMatrix** - Evaluates state against prioritized rules (Interrupt > Evasion > Backoff > Survival > Offense) with tie-breaking
5. **ActionExecutor** - Executes decisions via animations and movement control (CPR/BFCO/TK Dodge integration)
6. **Humanizer** - Adds organic feel (reaction latency, mistake probability, cooldowns)
7. **DodgeSystem** - Handles TK Dodge integration for evasion
8. **CombatStyleEnhancer** - Enhances NPC behavior based on combat styles (supports all action types)
9. **Config** - Configuration system using SimpleINI

## Important Notes

### Hook Implementation
✅ **Implemented using `stl::write_vfunc` on `RE::Character` vtable index 0xAD**
- Uses **post-hook pattern** (call original, then custom logic)
- Inspired by ProjectGapClose implementation
- More reliable than direct Actor vtable hooking

**Why Post-Hook?**
- **State Consistency**: Vanilla Update() runs first, ensuring accurate actor state
- **Less Interference**: We enhance vanilla AI rather than replace it
- **Animation Accuracy**: Animation states are fully updated before our logic runs
- **Better Compatibility**: Works with vanilla and other mods without conflicts
- **Proven Pattern**: ProjectGapClose uses the same approach successfully

See `HOOK_PATTERN_EXPLANATION.md` for detailed comparison of pre-hook vs post-hook patterns.

### Movement Control
✅ **Implemented via CPR (Combat Pathing Revolution) integration**
- Uses animation graph variables for movement control
- Automatically detects CPR availability
- Falls back gracefully if CPR is not installed
- Supports: Circling, Fallback, Advance, Backoff

### Action Types
✅ **Implemented 10 action types**:
- Bash (interrupt)
- Strafe (evasion)
- Retreat (survival)
- PowerAttack, Attack, SprintAttack (offense)
- Jump (evasion, uses dodge system with OAR animation replacement)
- Dodge (evasion, TK Dodge integration)
- Backoff (reactive, when target casting/drawing bow)
- Advancing (offense, when too far from target)

### Tie-Breaking System
✅ **Implemented intelligent tie-breaking**:
- When multiple decisions have the same priority, system uses:
  1. Intensity (higher = more committed)
  2. Health-based preferences (offensive when healthy, defensive when low)
  3. Distance-based preferences (optimal range for each action)
  4. Random selection for variety when scores are equal
- All decisions now have reasonable intensity values

### Performance Optimization
✅ **Implemented per-actor processing throttling**:
- Each actor has its own processing timer
- Actors are processed at configured interval (default 100ms)
- Reduces CPU usage while maintaining responsiveness
- Timer cleanup integrated with actor cleanup system

### Power Attack Detection
✅ **Implemented using `HighProcessData->attackData->data.flags`**
- Proper method via `currentProcess->high->attackData->data.flags`
- Checks for `RE::AttackData::AttackFlag::kPowerAttack`
- Based on ProjectGapClose implementation

### Configuration System
✅ **Implemented using SimpleINI**
- Configuration file: `EnhancedCombatAI.ini`
- Template provided: `EnhancedCombatAI.ini.template`
- Supports all major settings (humanizer, dodge, decision matrix, performance)

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Verify hook installation (check logs)
- [ ] Test bash interrupt functionality
- [ ] Test strafe/evasion with CPR and TK Dodge
- [ ] Test retreat/survival behavior with CPR fallback
- [ ] Verify no crashes or performance issues
- [ ] Test with different NPC levels (mistake probability)
- [ ] Test cooldowns work correctly
- [ ] Test with/without CPR installed
- [ ] Test with/without BFCO installed
- [ ] Test with/without Precision installed
- [ ] Test with/without TK Dodge installed

✅ **Advancing Action** - NPCs close distance when too far (CPR advancing integration)
✅ **Tie-Breaking System** - Intelligent selection when multiple decisions have same priority
✅ **Per-Actor Throttling** - Performance optimization via configurable processing intervals
✅ **Intensity Values** - All actions have intensity values for better decision making
✅ **BFCO State Optimization** - Removed redundant state resets, only set needed flags

## Mod Integrations

### Combat Pathing Revolution (CPR)
- **Purpose**: Enhanced movement control during combat
- **Method**: Animation graph variables (CPR_EnableCircling, CPR_EnableFallback, etc.)
- **Usage**: Automatically detected and used for strafe/retreat actions
- **Documentation**: See `CPR_INTEGRATION.md`

### BFCO Attack Framework
- **Purpose**: Enhanced attack animations and state management
- **Method**: Animation events (BFCOAttackStart_Comb, attackStartSprint) and graph variables
- **Usage**: Automatically detected and used for attack animations
- **Documentation**: See `BFCO_INTEGRATION.md`

### TK Dodge RE
- **Purpose**: Evasion system for dodging attacks
- **Method**: Animation events and TK Dodge API
- **Usage**: Integrated into DodgeSystem for evasion actions
- **Documentation**: See `DODGE_INTEGRATION.md`

### Precision
- **Purpose**: Accurate weapon reach calculations
- **Method**: Precision API (GetAttackCollisionCapsuleLength)
- **Usage**: Used in ActorStateObserver for accurate distance calculations
- **Documentation**: See `PRECISION_INTEGRATION.md`

## TK Dodge Integration

✅ **Dodge System Implemented!**

The evasion system now uses TK Dodge for NPCs:
- **DodgeSystem**: Handles TK Dodge integration for NPCs
- **Evasion**: When target is blocking, NPCs will dodge instead of strafe
- **Direction Calculation**: Automatically determines best dodge direction (Forward/Back/Left/Right)
- **Stamina Cost**: Respects TK Dodge stamina requirements
- **Cooldowns**: Integrated with Humanizer cooldown system

### Requirements
- TK Dodge RE must be installed and active
- NPCs need the TK Dodge animation events in their animation graphs
- Animation graph variables: `bIsDodging`, `bInJumpState`, `iStep`, `TKDR_IframeDuration`

### Dodge Events Used
- `TKDodgeForward` - Dodge forward
- `TKDodgeBack` - Dodge backward  
- `TKDodgeLeft` - Dodge left
- `TKDodgeRight` - Dodge right

## Next Steps

1. **In-Game Testing** - Verify all functionality works correctly
2. **Performance Optimization** - Profile and optimize if needed
3. **Additional Features** (Optional):
   - More sophisticated threat calculations
   - Per-NPC configuration overrides
   - Animation graph variable cleanup automation
   - Better vanilla AI suppression for certain actions (retreat, backoff)
4. **Documentation** - Keep documentation updated as features are added

## Known Limitations

1. **Movement Control**: Relies on CPR for advanced movement. Falls back to basic control if CPR not available.
2. **Animation Graph Variables**: Some features require animation graphs to support specific variables (CPR, TK Dodge, BFCO).
3. **Combat Style Requirements**: Some CPR features require "Close Range - Dueling" in combat style.

## Performance Considerations

- Processing is throttled via per-actor timers at `ProcessInterval` config setting (default 100ms)
- Each actor has its own processing timer to avoid processing every frame
- Actors are cleaned up when not in combat (including their timers)
- State gathering is optimized to avoid heavy operations
- Cooldowns prevent action spam
- BFCO state management optimized to only set needed flags

```bash
xmake build
```

The plugin will be built according to the `xmake.lua` configuration.

## Debugging

Enable debug logging by modifying the log level in your SKSE configuration or by using the SKSE logger directly. All components use the `LOG_*` macros from `Logger.h`.
